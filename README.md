# Freak_Squad

Freak Squad is a chaotic, fast-paced 2.5D action game developed over the course of 2 months at Game Academy in Avignon, France. Created by a passionate team of 13 programmers and around 10 graphic designers, the game combines bold visuals, tight gameplay mechanics, and a freaky-fun personality.
